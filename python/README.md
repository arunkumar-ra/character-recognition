A simple neural network with 1 hidden layer is implemented in nnet.py
A convolutional neural network is implemented in cnn.py with convolution and ReLU layer

TODO
---------------------------------------------
1. Optimize training time
2. Completely vectorize training for CNN
3. Add feature scaling
4. Add support for recognizing characters (dataset required)
5. Design architecture to fit SVHN dataset
